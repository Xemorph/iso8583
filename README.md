# ISO8583
A repository full of stuff which relates to ISO8583

The website `https://paymentcardtools.com/` contains a lot of useful tools
who are helpful working with ISO8583 or ISO8583-based messages. Give it a shot :)

There is a software available called `jPOS` which also contains some ISO8583 stuff;
especially the source code, written in `Java`, contains an ISO8583-Parser.
